This technical report describes our work of the Data Modelling class 2017.
The goal of this work is to implement a tool that supports the user to transform a relational schemed database (OLTP) into a dimensional model (OLAP).
Based on an approach proposed by Moody %TODO ref
a so called star schema will be produced out of an arbitrary database.

The program guides the user via commandline interface through all the neccessary steps to find an agreement of which tables are selected as transaction entities, component entities and classification entities.

% TODO eventually add Aggregation operator

As soon as the selection phase is done, our software will generate a dimensional model based on the input scheme and populate it from the original data.
