In this project, we implemented and tested creation of a basic dimensional model from Entity Relationship model. After studying existing methods of creating dimensional models we proposed an application. The application work flow starts with getting source database schema, suggesting a classification of entities and identifying hierarchies in model. The next step is collapsing hierarchies and aggregating data. Finally a new dimensional model database is created and the data is migrated.\par
The created dimensional database is in a form of a star schema. The star schema is either one, connecting all transaction entities, or multiple independent stars where each of them consists of a transaction entity and its dimensions. The schema shares the same dimensions between entities.\\
	The developed application can be extended by a graphical interface and a more complex suggestion system.
