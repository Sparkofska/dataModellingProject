In this project, we implemented and tested creation of a basic dimensional model from Entity Relationship model. After studying existing methods of creating dimensional models we proposed an application. The application work flow starts with getting source database schema, suggesting a classification of entities and identifying hierarchies in model. The next step is collapsing hierarchies and aggregating data. Finally a new dimensional model database is created and the data is migrated. 	The created dimensional database is in a form of a star schemas, each start consists of a fact table and its dimensions. The schema shares the same dimensions between fact tables but does not contain connection between fact tables.
	The developed application can be extended by a connection between facts table to contain full star scheme of source database.
