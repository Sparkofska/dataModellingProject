\subsection{Application Design}

The tool we implemented is designed as pipeline that takes an arbitrary database as input and outputs a set of SQL scripts, which can be run to create a new database having a dimensional scheme.
The user is guided throughout the whole process via a command line interface, which enforces him to do the steps in the right order.
As a special feature we implemented a mechanism to save the current working state in order to continue the work at a later point in time.
As soon as all the specifications about the resulting scheme are made, the program will output and run the resulting SQL scripts in a way that the new database is created and the original data is populated.

As a first step the input database is parsed using the JDBC library\footnote{\url{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/jdbc/index.html}}.
